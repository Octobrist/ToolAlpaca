Both the standard answer and the AI assistant's solution call the same functions, `getSpecificVerse` and `getAllVersesFromChapter`, with the same parameters. However, there are a few discrepancies:\n\n1. In the `getSpecificVerse` function, the AI assistant uses a range (\"10-18\") for the \"verse\" parameter, while the standard answer uses a single verse number (10). The documentation does not specify whether a range is acceptable for this parameter, so it's unclear whether this is correct.\n\n2. The AI assistant does not include the \"language\" parameter in its function calls. The standard answer includes \"English\" as the language, but the task instruction does not specify a language, so this is not necessarily incorrect.\n\n3.
