For the process, refer to the standard answer:\n - The standard answer and the AI assistant's solution includes function names, parameters and function returns. Therefore, it is acceptable to adjust the call situation based on the function return, such as retrying when the function errors, calling function `getDetails` for more information, calling function `retrievalDataFromFile` when function's return is too long.\n - Random calls to unrelated functions are not allowed.\n - The solution must contain the main steps in the standard answer.\n - The necessary parameters of the function need to be consistent with the standard answer.
