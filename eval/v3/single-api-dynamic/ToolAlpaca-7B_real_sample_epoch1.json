This aligns with the task instruction to fetch a list of fruits belonging to the \"Sapindales\" order. \n\nHowever, the response from the AI assistant's solution was a 404 error with the message \"Fruit not found for the specified order\". This indicates that there were no fruits found for the \"Sapindales\" order at the time of the AI assistant's request. This is different from the standard answer which returned a successful response with a list of fruits. \n\nThe difference in responses could be due to the timing of the API requests.

For the process, refer to the standard answer:\n - The standard answer and the AI assistant's solution includes function names, parameters and function returns. Therefore, it is acceptable to adjust the call situation based on the function return, such as retrying when the function errors, calling function `getDetails` for more information, calling function `retrievalDataFromFile` when function's return is too long.\n - Random calls to unrelated functions are not allowed.\n - The solution at time step t+1 may not fully solve the problem, but it must provide some assistance like the standard answer.\n - The necessary parameters of the function need to be consistent with the standard answer. Parameters not mentioned in the instruction can be inconsistent.\n4. It is not required that AI Assistant's Solution be consistent with the response of the standard answer, due to different timing of API requests.\n5. You need to comprehensively judge whether the solution at time step t+1 and its response have collaboration with known API calls from time steps 1 to t facilitated the resolution of task Instructions.\n6.
