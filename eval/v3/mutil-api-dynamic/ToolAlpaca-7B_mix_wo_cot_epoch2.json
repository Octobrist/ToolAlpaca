Axolotls are solitary animals and do not form social groups.\n4. They are found in a variety of habitats, including lakes, rivers, and ponds.\n5. Axolotls have a unique skin coloration, with a range of colors including wild, leucistic, and albino.\n6. They have a long, slender body with a flat, broad head.\n7. Axolotls have a long, sticky tongue that they use to catch prey.\n8. They have a slow metabolism and can survive for long periods of time without food.\n9.

However, the AI assistant's solution calls the `getSpecificVerse` function without the \"language\" parameter, which results in a 400 error response. Instead of correcting the missing parameter, the AI assistant then calls the `getAllVersesFromChapter` function, which is not part of the standard answer and does not fulfill the task instruction of retrieving a specific verse.\n\nThe final response from the AI assistant does not fulfill the task instruction. The response includes multiple verses from Revelation chapter 22, but it does not specifically provide the text of Revelation 22:17.
