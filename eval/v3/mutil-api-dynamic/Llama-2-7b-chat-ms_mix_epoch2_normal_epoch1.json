However, it receives a 400 status code indicating a \"Bad Request\" due to an unsupported 'year' parameter. This seems to be a discrepancy between the documentation and the actual API behavior.\n\nIn response to the error, the AI assistant then calls the `searchHolidays` function, which is not part of the standard answer. The parameters used in this function call are not entirely relevant to the task instruction. The 'keywords' parameter is set to 'family gatherings', which is not a specific holiday and may not yield the desired results. The 'startDate' and 'endDate' parameters are set to cover only the month of March, which is not representative of the entire year as requested in the task instruction.\n\nFinally, the AI assistant calls the `getHolidaysByCountry` function again with the same parameters as the first call.
